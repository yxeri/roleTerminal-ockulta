# roleTerminal
![Build status](https://api.travis-ci.org/yxeri/roleTerminal.svg)

roleTerminal is an initiative to create a platform to be used in-game during LARPs. It has so far been used on two post-apocalyptic LARP events, 
[Blodsband reloaded](http://bbreloaded.se) and [Rex](http://www.rexlajv.se), and will be used at [Ockulta Medborgarbyr√•n](http://www.ockultamedborgarbyran.com).

## Branches

Master contains the latest stable release. Develop contains the latest unstable release.

## Deployment
There's a container available at [Docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/yxeri/roleterminal/). Docker is the preferred method of deployment of the app.

The envar CONFIGPATH has to be set to a valid location for the module [roleHaven-config](https://github.com/yxeri/roleHaven-config) (a fork of your own or one
of the existing ones). It will be installed with npm.

## Configuration

roleTerminal has a separate configuration module, found at roleHaven-config](https://github.com/yxeri/roleHaven-config).
